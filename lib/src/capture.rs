//! Stream-based capturing
//!
//! This library supports extraction of BFI data from WiFi packets. There are two
//! main ways to work with these packets:
//!  - Load all of them from a file, then process as batch
//!  - Open a pcap stream (either online or from file) and process piece by piece
//!
//! This module implements
